# Executive Summary

Open Source Academics (OSA) aims to facilitate and expand the educational experience on a global stage by providing scalable curriculum and standardized course materials through an open source platform. To fully understand the diverse nature of OSA, this summary will be broken down into seven discrete sections: Motivation, Mission, Platform, Stakeholders, Infinity Committee, Incentives and Roadmap.

## Motivation

The lack of education on a global scale shows an inversely correlated trend for many of the world’s greatest problems[1]. From environmental decline to personal health and even war, an educated population leads to a decrease in negatively impacting events. OSA believes that free and fruitful STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineer, Arts, and Mathematics) educational content should belong to anyone with the ability to access digital assets. Built upon a fair, collaborative and welcoming platform, OSA facilitates contribution and consumption of everything under its umbrella. The OSA platform aims to incentivize well established institutions and industry while also providing a paradigm shift in educational standards for underserved regions of the world. Fragmented, speculative learning materials and pay to play platforms may also see a benefit in the collaborative and open environment provided by OSA.

## Our Mission

OSA will unite industry and academia to create, and host a fully functional and open sourced educational platform which facilitates consumption and contribution of standardized educational curriculum and incentivized course materials on a global scale (with a current focus on STEAM content). OSA will work with stakeholders (Infinity Committee and Community) to achieve a balanced set of standards and incentives which encourage collaboration and drive content quality and growth.

## The Platform
For the time being, OSA will live in a version controlled environment on Github[2] and will follow an open source development methodology with multiple licensing options. In the effort to provide a fully welcoming and friendly user experience, OSA will offer comprehensive startup guides (with contribution guidelines and tutorials), optional service plans/contracts and incentivized academic offerings to partners and community who are looking to create and host niche materials. Incentives in all directions (between Industry, Academia and Community) must first be approved by the OSA “Infinity Committee” prior to its validity under the OSA umbrella. All OSA approved materials will be made publically available and fully consumable to anyone with an internet connection, OSA licenses should allow consumers to download and share digital assets freely.

## Stakeholders

Independent parties with an interest in OSA who stand to gain from its success will hear by be considered as stakeholders. There will be three separate but equally represented stakeholder groups (or committees). Each group will interact with OSA differently.

## Infinity Committee

The **infinity committee** joins multiple groups of people appointed to specific functions under the OSA umbrella. Currently consisting of Industry, Academic and Community representatives, each sub-committee will be responsible for moving their sectors forward within the initiative. Joint by common goals set by OSA, each committee must act on behalf of the initiative, this is to drive both the success of the other committees and OSA as a whole.
